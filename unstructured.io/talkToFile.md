## 🔧 Utilizing the Unstructured Library

In developing **talkToFile**, the `unstructured` library has been instrumental. This open-source suite simplifies ingestion and pre-processing for various formats, from PDFs to images.

**Highlights**:

- **🧩 Modularity**: The library's architecture ensures seamless integration across platforms.
- **🔄 Data Transformation**: Efficient conversion from unstructured data to structured outputs is a standout feature.

### Unstructured API:

I'm pleased to note the recent launch of the **Unstructured API** 🚀, which offers the library's capabilities via API calls. While the API remains free to access, an [API Key](#) is required.

### 📊 Exploring Chipper Model:

I've also been evaluating the beta release of the **Chipper model** 📑, optimized for high-resolution documents. To incorporate Chipper in API requests, use the `hi_res_model_name=chipper` parameter.

## 🌍 Environment Variables

1. Configure your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set your `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`:

```
UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 🚀 Usage

To use **talkToFile**, run the following commands:

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js [command] [options]
```

## 📜 Commands

### 📥 Load

The `load` command enables users to load a file and store its processed data in a specified directory.

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js load --path="./path/to/your/file.pdf" --saveDir="./path/to/saveDir"
```

### ❓ Ask

The `ask` command allows users to query the loaded content and retrieve relevant information.

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js ask --question="Your query here" --saveDir="./path/to/previouslySavedDir"
```

Certainly! Let's integrate emojis to make the section more engaging:

## 🧠 TensorFlow.js Embeddings

The TensorFlow.js Embeddings integration allows you to compute embeddings directly in your browser or Node.js environment. It leverages the power of TensorFlow.js, ensuring that your data remains local 🛡️ and is not sent to any third-party services. While this offers the advantage of privacy 🔒 and no requirement for API keys, be aware that it may demand more memory and processing power 💻 than other embedding solutions.

### 📦 Installation

To utilize the TensorFlow.js embeddings, you'll need to install several packages:

```bash
pnpm add @tensorflow/tfjs-core @tensorflow/tfjs-converter @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-cpu
```

If you're interested in using the sentence-transformers embeddings, install the following package:

```bash
pnpm add @tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder
```

### ⚙️ Configuration

In the `unstructured.io/talkToFile.js` file, you can specify the type of embedding you'd like to use. For instance, to use TensorFlow.js embeddings, the relevant imports and initialization would look like this:

```javascript
import "@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-cpu"
import { TensorFlowEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/tensorflow"

const embeddings = new TensorFlowEmbeddings()
```

By setting up and using the appropriate embeddings, you can tailor the performance and functionality to your specific needs.

Emojis can make the content more relatable and visually appealing, but it's essential to strike a balance to maintain professionalism, especially in documentation or instructional content.

## 🔍 Examples

1. Loading a file:

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js load --path="./data/survival.pdf" --saveDir="./cache/survival.json"
```

2. Querying the loaded content:

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js ask --question="how do I survive in an accident?" --saveDir="./cache/survival.json"
```
