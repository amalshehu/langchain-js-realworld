## 🔧 Utilizing the Unstructured Library

In developing **talkToFile**, the `unstructured` library has been instrumental. This open-source suite simplifies ingestion and pre-processing for various formats, from PDFs to images.

**Highlights**:

- **🧩 Modularity**: The library's architecture ensures seamless integration across platforms.
- **🔄 Data Transformation**: Efficient conversion from unstructured data to structured outputs is a standout feature.

### Unstructured API:

I'm pleased to note the recent launch of the **Unstructured API** 🚀, which offers the library's capabilities via API calls. While the API remains free to access, an [API Key](#) is required.

### 📊 Exploring Chipper Model:

I've also been evaluating the beta release of the **Chipper model** 📑, optimized for high-resolution documents. To incorporate Chipper in API requests, use the `hi_res_model_name=chipper` parameter.

## 🌍 Environment Variables

1. Configure your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set your `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`:

```
UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 🚀 Usage

To use **talkToFile**, run the following commands:

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js [command] [options]
```

## 📜 Commands

### 📥 Load

The `load` command enables users to load a file and store its processed data in a specified directory.

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js load --path="./path/to/your/file.pdf" --saveDir="./path/to/saveDir"
```

### ❓ Ask

The `ask` command allows users to query the loaded content and retrieve relevant information.

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js ask --question="Your query here" --saveDir="./path/to/previouslySavedDir"
```

## 🔍 Examples

1. Loading a file:

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js load --path="./data/survival.pdf" --saveDir="./cache/survival.json"
```

2. Querying the loaded content:

```bash
node unstructured.io/talkToFile.js ask --question="how do I survive in an accident?" --saveDir="./cache/survival.json"
```
